"# SmallMitosis" 

WORKFLOW DIAGRAM OF SMALLMITOS

Hardware Requirements
The experiments are performed on 2.4 GHz Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2630 CPU with one NVIDIA Tesla M40 GPU of 12GB memory.

Software Requirements
The pre-processing techniques (i.e. Haar wavelet decomposition, color augmentation, and stain normalization) are implemented in the MATLAB R2018a program.
The complete SmallMitosis detection framework is implemented in Python , C++ (using the Caffe framework with CuDNN) and other common pakeges.
